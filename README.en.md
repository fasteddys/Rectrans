The text recognition is performed by setting a rectangular area,
and the recognized text is translated. No need for `hook`, basically suitable for all types of game text translation.

2. Auto translate.
3. Provide translation of `English`→`Simplified Chinese`  `Japanese`→`Simplified Chinese` `Korean`→`Simplified Chinese`.
4. Topmost of the main window. 
5. The original text display. 
6. The translation display. 


### Future:

1. More language support.
2. Rectangular area to cover the original text by translation text.
3. Font Family setting.
